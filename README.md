# hashes & filesizes of many map/bsp files for Counter-Strike: Source

Used to help with archiving maps & hosting a big fastdl.

Originally intended for bhop/surf/xc/kz/trikz maps... and then it spiraled out of control...
- movement/skill gamemode maps get the most love though... there's around 2000 rows of duplicate mapnames excluding bhop/surf/xc/kz/trikz/etc so... that will probably never be proactively dealt with for `/maps/` / `canon.csv`....
	- feel free to request setting the correct version of a map though

## WHAT IS WHAT
- `fastdlsite/`
	- [`check.fastdl.me`](https://check.fastdl.me/)
		- Map submission form and commands to check your `maps` folder for unique things to upload
	- [`fastdl.me`](https://fastdl.me/)
		- The homepage
	- `fastdlpy/`
		- `99-cloudflared.conf`
			- some sysctls I put on to silence some cloudflared warnings
		- `main.py`
			- The meat of the name-to-hash redirections for [main.fastdl.me](https://main.fastdl.me/)
		- `requirements.txt`
			- pip requirements yada yada
	- `fastdlpy_nocf/`
		- non-cloudflare version of fastdlpy. Could probably just be merged with fastdlpy and use environment-variables to configure it instead.
	- [`main.fastdl.me`](https://main.fastdl.me/)
		- Mainly placeholder files for keeping the directory structure.
	- [`mainr2.fastdl.me`](https://mainr2.fastdl.me/)
		- More placeholder files.
	- `nginx/`
		- Most of the nginx website configuration for [main.fastdl.me](https://main.fastdl.me/)
	- `nginx_nocf/`
		- non-cloudflare version of the nginx configs. Old and won't be used.
	- `venus.fastdl.me/`
		- HTML files for the subdomain that serves some static files.
	- `compose.yml`
		- Docker compose file for spinning up a fastdl node.
	- `compose_nocf.yml`
		- Docker compose file for spinning up a non-cloudflare fastdl node.
	- `embedded-privacy-policy.html`
		- Basic minimal privacy policy that's appended to pages.
- `filters/`
	- CSV files for removing dupes, bad maps, etc from the fastdl.me `/maps/` page
- `processed/`
	- Built website code after you run `python process.py`
- `unprocessed/`
	- CSV files for all the map scrapes & dumps used by fastdl.me
- `canon.csv`
	- CSV with which hash to use for particular map names. Needed for maps that update without changing the name for example
- `gamebanana-automatic.py`
	- Automatic gamebanana downloader & uploader script
- `index_bottom.html`
	- A template used by `process.py` when generating map folder HTML index files
- `index_top.html`
	- A template used by `process.py` when generating map folder HTML index files
- `maps-hasher.py`
	- The map hasher & dumper-to-CSV-files part of adding new maps.
- `process.py`
	- The step to parse all the CSV files to produce the website files & sqlite db to put into `processed/`
- `recently_added.csv`
	- List of recently added map files that is put at the top of map folder HTML index files
- `todo.txt`
	- A poorly named file...


Sister repo at https://github.com/srcwr/maps-cstrike-more
- For every bsp: has a csv with the packed file list & a dump of the entity lump.
	- The entity lumps are compressed because the repo would've been 4 gigabytes otherwise...



"How do you determine what map should be in canon.csv?"
- First: don't use a version if it's corrupted/crashing :)
- Use the latest version from gamebanana if possible.
	- Otherwise `changelevel hash123123123` & `stripper_dump` on both maps.
	Then diff the entity lumps .cfg from that & check if one has a higher `mapversion` key at the top of the file.
		- Otherwise one of the cfgs might have things removed if someone edited the map so generally pick the one that doesn't have things removed. This one is subjective because somethings *should* be removed because they're stupid or break multiplayer but generally using the original release is the "right" move.
			- Otherwise otherwise otherwise pick a version of the map that's packed with textures.


Some useful sql things...
```sql
SELECT m.mapname, m.sha1 FROM maps_unfiltered m
JOIN (SELECT mapname, COUNT(*) c FROM maps_unfiltered GROUP BY mapname HAVING c > 1) t
ON m.mapname = t.mapname

ORDER BY m.mapname ASC, m.sha1 ASC



SELECT m.mapname, m.sha1 FROM maps_unfiltered m
JOIN (SELECT sha1, COUNT(*) c FROM maps_unfiltered GROUP BY sha1 HAVING c > 1) t
ON m.sha1 = t.sha1

ORDER BY m.sha1 ASC, m.mapname ASC



SELECT m.* FROM maps_canon m
JOIN (SELECT mapname, COUNT(*) c FROM maps_canon GROUP BY mapname HAVING c > 1) t
ON m.mapname = t.mapname

ORDER BY m.mapname ASC, m.sha1 ASC

# WHERE m.mapname LIKE '%bh%' OR m.mapname LIKE '%xc%' OR m.mapname LIKE '%kz%' OR m.mapname LIKE '%surf%' OR m.mapname LIKE '%trikz%'
# ^^^ You can also put this before the ORDER BY



SELECT m.mapname, m.sha1 FROM maps_canon m
JOIN (SELECT sha1, COUNT(*) c FROM maps_canon GROUP BY sha1 HAVING c > 1) t
ON m.sha1 = t.sha1

ORDER BY m.sha1 ASC, m.mapname ASC
```
